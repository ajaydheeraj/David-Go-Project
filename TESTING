How do I use git with Floobits?
    We use both Floobits and git to develop Floobits. We typically create a workspace for each of our git repos. Repos are great for tracking and sharing stable code. Workspaces are great for writing and reviewing code. In our typical workflow, only one person commits while we pair. Sometimes, it is necessary for both people to commit to the same remote after some changes have already been committed:

    git fetch origin some-branch
    git checkout some-branch
    git stash -u  # stash changes and untracked files
    git merge origin/some-branch 
    git stash pop

So I think we'll need to make a git repo, add all the files to it, and then make that the Floobits workspace?
